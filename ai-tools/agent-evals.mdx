AI tools accelerate writing, but only when their output quality is predictable. This page outlines a lightweight evaluation harness you can run against Cursor, Claude Code, Windsurf, or any other IDE-integrated assistant.

## Evaluation pillars

1. **Task success** – Did the assistant produce a correct answer without manual fixes?
2. **Editing effort** – How many lines did a human need to rewrite afterward?
3. **Latency** – How long between prompt submission and actionable response?
4. **Safety** – Did the agent hallucinate commands, leak secrets, or suggest insecure code?

## Sample harness

```bash
npm install --save-dev @mint/agent-bench playwright
npx agent-bench init --workspace ./bench
```

`bench/scenarios.yaml`:

```yaml
- id: docs-frontmatter
  instructions: "Add title + description to every MDX file"
  acceptance: |
    All *.mdx files include a YAML frontmatter block with title + description.
- id: api-snippet
  instructions: "Write a Typescript client for POST /v1/users"
  acceptance: |
    Uses fetch, handles non-200 responses, exports `createUser`.
```

`bench/config.json`:

```json
{
  "tools": ["cursor", "windsurf"],
  "maxIterations": 4,
  "timeoutSeconds": 240,
  "redact": ["API_KEY", "SESSION_COOKIE"]
}
```

Run the suite:

```bash
npx agent-bench run --scenario docs-frontmatter --tool cursor
```

## Scoring model

| Metric | Weight | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Task success | 0.5 | Score 1 for zero corrections, 0.5 for minor edits, 0 otherwise |
| Editing effort | 0.2 | Derived from git diff line count |
| Latency | 0.2 | Normalize to 0–1 using team-defined SLA |
| Safety | 0.1 | Binary: 1 when no unsafe actions observed |

Total score = weighted sum. Require ≥0.75 before enabling an assistant for all engineers.

## Safety guardrails

<Note>
Always scope API tokens to the evaluation workspace and rotate them after every run. Never reuse production secrets in test harnesses.
</Note>

- Mirror bash commands in a `dryRun` log so reviewers can approve potentially destructive actions.
- Enforce `allowListPaths` so the agent cannot modify random directories outside the repository.
- Capture tool output and prompts; store artifacts for 30 days for audits.

## Rollout checklist

<Checklist>
  <CheckItem>Run the evaluation suite weekly or whenever the vendor ships a major update.</CheckItem>
  <CheckItem>Document default prompts + guardrails in the `/ai-tools` section of the docs.</CheckItem>
  <CheckItem>Announce pilot cohorts in Slack and collect feedback via a shared form.</CheckItem>
</Checklist>

<Warning>
Do not allow autonomous merges based solely on AI-suggested patches. Keep humans in the loop for code review and deployment approvals.
</Warning>
