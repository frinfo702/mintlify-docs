title: 'New Plant Webhook'
description: 'Receive notifications whenever a plant is added to the store.'
openapi: 'WEBHOOK /plant/webhook'
---

Uyu calls this webhook every time a plant is created. Return a 2xx status code within five seconds to acknowledge receipt—otherwise the event is retried with exponential backoff (up to 5 attempts).

## Payload

<ResponseField name="id" type="integer" required>
Unique identifier assigned to the plant.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="name" type="string" required>
Plant name from the catalog.
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="tag" type="string">
Informational label such as `succulent` or `indoor`.
</ResponseField>

<RequestExample>
```json Event payload
{
  "id": 501,
  "name": "Monstera Deliciosa",
  "tag": "indoor"
}
```
</RequestExample>

## Responding

<ResponseExample>
```http 200 OK
{
  "received": true
}
```
</ResponseExample>

<Tip>You can include any JSON body in the response. Only the HTTP status code is evaluated by the webhook delivery service.</Tip>

## Security recommendations

- Host the webhook behind HTTPS. Self-signed certificates are rejected.
- Validate the request origin (for example, by checking IP allowlists) until signature headers are available.
- Respond quickly. Perform slow work asynchronously to avoid retries.
