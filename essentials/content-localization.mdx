Localization succeeds when source content is disciplined. Freeze English copy before each translation batch, keep terminology consistent, and automate regression checks whenever source files change.

## Workflow at a glance

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare source">
    Lint MDX, resolve TODOs, and export strings via `mint export --format xliff`. Freeze the commit hash so vendors work from an immutable reference.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Translate">
    Send XLIFF files plus the terminology glossary. Require translators to keep component tags (for example `<Tip>` or fenced code blocks) untouched.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Validate">
    Re-import translations with `mint import --locale es-ES` and run automated link + screenshot tests.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## File organization

```
locales/
  es-ES/
    index.mdx
    quickstart.mdx
  ja-JP/
    index.mdx
```

- Match the English file tree exactly. Missing files break locale-specific navigation.
- Store canonical terminology in `locales/glossary.csv` with columns `term,en-US,es-ES,ja-JP`.

## QA rubric

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Terminology drift">
    Confirm glossary adherence for product names and UI labels; reject translations that invent synonyms.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Component safety">
    `<Tip>`, `<Warning>`, and fenced code blocks must remain intact. When in doubt, re-run `mint lint` to detect malformed components.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Context accuracy">
    Verify references to time zones, release dates, and screenshots remain relevant for the locale.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
Encourage translators to leave reviewer comments inline (using HTML comments) instead of editing structural metadata. Example: `<!-- Need confirmation on "Workspace" vs "Project" -->`.
</Tip>

<Check>
Once localized docs pass QA, tag the release (for example `docs-i18n-2025.03`) and notify support so in-product links can start pointing to the localized routes.
